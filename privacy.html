This information is not personal information and collected for statistical purposes only. For further details of how we use Google Analytics, please refer to the 'Website Useage Management' section below.
            
            You may also choose to provide us with personal information if, for example, you subscribe to our newsletter, send us questions through e-mail, register for an event or participate in our on-line activities.

For further details of the personal information we may collect and how we may use this, please refer to the 'Our Services' section on our detailed Privacy Statement.
            
            Personal information that is collected by the Department/BV will be used by, and disclosed to, Departmental employees, contractorsor third party vendors whose duties require them to use it in order to help the Department/BV fulfil transactions with you or to otherwise help the Department/BV provide goods and/or services to you. Such contractors may be located inside or outside Victoria. For further details of how third parties will process and handle personal information passed onto them, please refer to the 'Our Services’ section in our detailed Privacy Statement. Personal information collected by the Department/BV will also be disclosed to the cloud service provider, Telstra or collected on behalf of the Department by third party service providers, such as Eventbrite.
            
            Access to and correction of personal information

            Information we collect via the BV website and social media/eUpdate channels
            If you choose to engage with any of the services provided on our online channels we collect information in two ways:
            
            Information you provide  (Personal Information) For example, to use some of our services we may ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number. If you want to join our social media communities, we have access to your public profile, which may include your name and photo

            If you access social media/subscription channels such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and the Business Victoria Update, you should be aware that any information you post onto such media is available for the public to see. You should therefore check your individual privacy settings for profiles and accounts on social media networks and their privacy policies.

            Sharing of personal information on Business Victoria social channels, including through the closed Facebook Group, I am a business owner in Victoria, Australia, is done on the onus of the individual posting. Any third party personal information, including but not limited to email addresses and phone numbers, should be shared only with the express consent of the individual to whom the information pertains. The administrators of Business Victoria social channels reserve the right to remove posts without consulting the poster where issues of consent or data privacy are deemed to be of concern.
            
            Information collected via the Australian Business Register
            The State Government of Victoria has an obligation to keep businesses abreast of changes to Legislation and Acts that are of critical importance and present regulatory compliance obligations.

            This information includes, but is not limited to, email addresses and mobile phone numbers utilised in email and SMS communication sent as the Business Victoria Update.
